CONFIGURATION README

How to read the files:
-Each file is only as long as needed, one line.
-Values are separated by spaces.
-The line ends with new line character.

d -> direct mapped
	-The next number after a 'd' is the cache size.
s -> set associative
	-The next number after a 's' is the number of ways, then the size.
f -> fully associative
	-The next number after a 'f' is the cache size.

For example the line:
s 4 4 s 4 4 d 32  means
|     |     |
|     |     direct mapped 32kB L2
|     4-way set associative, 4kB in size L1 Dcache
4-way set associative, 4kB in size L1 Icache
