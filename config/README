CONFIGURATION README

How to read the files:
-Each file is only as long as needed, one line.
-Values are separated by commas.
-The line ends with new line character.

0 -> direct mapped
	-The next number after a '0' is the cache size.
1 -> set associative
	-The next number after a '1' is the number of ways, then the size.
2 -> fully associative
	-The next number after a '2' is the cache size.

For example the line:
144144032  means
|  |  |
|  |  direct mapped 32kB L2
|  4-way set associative, 4kB in size L1 Dcache
4-way set associative, 4kB in size L1 Icache
